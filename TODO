 * external : any external packages that we will ship with SMP
 * smpgui : widgets and user interface
    - all designer generated .py files prefixed with ui_: ui_mywidget.py
    - api objects and modules should not have ui_ or gui in the name
 * smpcore : non-gui code, like configuration utilities, spec wrappers
 * scripts : executable programs
