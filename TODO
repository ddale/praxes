=== The following needs to happen before SMP can be used for experiments ===

  RHEL5 installed on F3 station computer

X save images to edf files and plain text files

  move residuals from spectrum fitting into a separate plot, just below the 
    spectrum plot. Keep ylimits fixed.

  Fix bug in starting a second scan (some bug in caching of element images)

  add colorbar to image canvas

  emit signal when creating advancedfitanalysis, which sets the X-axis and,
    if appropriate, Y-axis limits.

  if scan is not mesh-type, create a different kind of plot canvas in the 
    lower window. Simple plot instead of an image.

  scanfeedback does not load user's pymcaconfig file, uses default.

  need unified deadtime correction reported by spec, preferrably in S:
    vortex: ICR/OCR*Real/Live
    xflash: pulser_rate/reported_rate

  need new variable that reports absolute flux at sample, can this be done in S?

  copy skipmode macro into smp-data, run (but dont enable) at smp startup
    macro needs to be improved:
        set variable to monitoring
        set threshold
        some way to report when a point is skipped
    ability to switch skipmode on and off in smp
    if point is skipped, advancedfitanalysis needs to know so it doesnt
        pass mcaData to PyMca

  wire up remaining widgets:
    spectrum yscale: lin/log
    save image button
    min/max/autoscale
    fix pymcaloadconfig toolbar button

  element images can (but dont have to) report concentrations instead of areas

  write setup.py for distribution

=== Future capabilities ===

  Ability to create or modify pymca config files using PyMca
    pymca modify config toolbar button enabled

  measure standards, compare measured concentrations with accepted values, modify
    pymca config file to improve agreement

  statistical analysis, like cluster analysis, on concentrations data

  ability to click on a pixel, have it display the spectrum, along with the fit,
    and an opportunity to remeasure the point or redo the fit

  video monitoring: convert MacCHESS project to Qt4
