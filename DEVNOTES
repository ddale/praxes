In order to work on SMP development, the spectromicroscopy 
working directory and the "external" directory must both be 
on your PYTHONPATH. This can be done by adding the following 
to your .bashrc file, (assuming you use bash):

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/spectromicroscopy:${PYTHONPATH}
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/spectromicroscopy/spectromicroscopy/external:${PYTHONPATH}

of course, replace /path/to with whatever is appropriate.

You will also have to have the following packages installed:

enthought.traits (version 3, from svn)
python (version 2.4 or later, preferrably 2.5 or later)
Qt4 (preferrably version 4.3.1 or later)
PyQt4 (preferrably version 4.3 or later)
matplotlib (0.90.1 or later)
configobj
PyMca
