In order to work on xpaxs development, the xpaxs working directory and the
"external" directory must both be on your PYTHONPATH. This can be done by
adding the following to your .bashrc file, (assuming you use bash):

# change the next line to point to your xpaxs directory:
xpaxs=~/src/xpaxs
export PYTHONPATH=${xpaxs}:${xpaxs}/xpaxs/spec/external:${PYTHONPATH}
export PATH=${xpaxs}/scripts:${PATH}

You will also have to have the following packages installed:

numpy (version 1.1 or later)
python (version 2.5 or later)
Qt4 (preferrably version 4.3.3 or later)
PyQt4 (preferrably version 4.3.3 or later)
matplotlib (0.92.1 or later)
PyMca (version 4.2.4 or later)
pexpect (for the console module)
pp (parallel python for concurrent data analysis)
pytables (version 2.0.3 or later)
