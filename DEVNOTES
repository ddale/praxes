In order to work on SMP development, the spectromicroscopy
working directory and the "external" directory must both be
on your PYTHONPATH. This can be done by adding the following
to your .bashrc file, (assuming you use bash):

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/spectromicroscopy:${PYTHONPATH}
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/spectromicroscopy/spectromicroscopy/external:${PYTHONPATH}

of course, replace /path/to with whatever is appropriate.

You will also have to have the following packages installed:

python (version 2.5 or later)
Qt4 (preferrably version 4.3.3 or later)
PyQt4 (preferrably version 4.3.3 or later)
matplotlib (0.92.1 or later)
PyMca
pexpect (for the console module)
pp (parallel python for concurrent data analysis)
