In order to work on xpaxs development, in addition to the installing the xpaxs
dependencies, the xpaxs working directory and the "external" directory must both
be on your PYTHONPATH. With Linux, this can be done by adding the following to
your .bashrc file, (assuming you use bash)::

   # change the next line to point to your xpaxs directory:
   xpaxs=~/src/xpaxs
   export PYTHONPATH=${xpaxs}:${xpaxs}/xpaxs/spec/external:${PYTHONPATH}
   export PATH=${xpaxs}/scripts:${PATH}

With Windows, you have to edit your environment variables in the System
Settings.
