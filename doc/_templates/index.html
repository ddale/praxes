  <h1>Welcome</h1>

  <p>
    XPaXS is a collection of python packages and libraries for X-ray Science. XPaXS
    was developed with the hope that it many will find it useful, and many will
    contribute to --- and take credit for --- its development. XPaXS is open source
    software, all of its dependencies are compatible with the GNU Public License.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project began with the goal of providing useful real-time feedback and
    analysis of scanning X-ray fluorescence microscopy experiments, using several
    existing and very successful libraries such as <a href="http://pymca.sourceforge.net/">PyMca</a>,
    <a href="http://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/TBS/BLISS/BLISS-Applications/">SpecClient</a>,
    <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a>,
    <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt4</a>,
    <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>,
    <a href="http://h5py.alfven.org/">h5py</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.parallelpython.com/">ParallelPython</a>. It quickly
    became clear, however, that with a little abstraction XPaXS was poised to
    provide a framework for X-ray science in general.

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>
    Someone remind me to post some screenshots and some references to papers
    that used XPaXS for data acquistition and analysis.
