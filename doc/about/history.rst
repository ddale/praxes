Praxes was started in 2007 (under another name) by Darren Dale while he was a
staff scientist at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Darren began
using Python as an open alternative to Matlab, and started Praxes to provide a
flexible environment for integrating the various tools required for analysis
of data collected at synchrotron laboratories.
