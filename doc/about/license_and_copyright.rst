Copyright Policy
================

Praxes uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Praxes. These contributions are typically changes
(diffs/commits) to the repositories. The source code in its entirety is not
the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the
collective copyright of the entire Praxes Development Team. Individual
contributors wishing to maintain a record of contributions to which they hold
specific copyright should indicate their copyright in the commit message of
the change to the repository.

Any new code contributed to Praxes must be licensed under the BSD license or
a similar (MIT) open source license.

Miscellaneous
=============

Praxes is built upon PyQt4 and dip, which are provided by Riverbank Computing
(http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/news) under the terms of the GNU Public
License. Riverbank Computing explicitly grants additional rights to license
such derived work under the terms of the BSD license (among others). This
allows Praxes to be developed and distributed under the terms of the BSD
license. Commercial projects can be derived from Praxes, but if such a project
continues to derive from PyQt4, a commercial license is required from
Riverbank Computing.
